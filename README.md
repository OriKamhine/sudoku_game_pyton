# sudoku_game_pyton
I built the game "Sudoko" as we know it (9x9) in python. The code is separated into Python files and classes.
This project contains the graphic and logical idea of sudoku and i tried to make the best of it. 
There are 3 levels and you pick which one you want. 
I created it becuse i really like the game and i wanted to implement it on python.
